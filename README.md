## Salesforce Heroku Roadmap

This is the public roadmap for Heroku. Welcome!

[See the roadmap Â»](https://github.com/orgs/heroku/projects/130)

## Introduction

The roadmap is where Heroku shares details on what we're working on, and is a place for Heroku customers to propose feature requests and ideas for improvements. Feel free to comment on existing issues and to open new ones.

## FAQs

**Q: What do the roadmap categories mean?** 

* *Researching* - We're looking into this idea, gathering requirements and coming up with designs. Sharing your use-case for a proposed feature is very valuable for items in this phase.
* *Working on it* - Actively being worked on. We're finalizing requirements but there's still time to incorporate feedback and changes.
* *Coming soon* - We expect to deliver this within the next month or two. Items tagged pilot, beta, or dev preview may be in this state for longer as we work on getting them to GA.
* *Shipped* - Done & delivered as generally available, unless otherwise noted.

**Q: Why did you build this?**

A: We want to share more details about what we're working on and gather feedback from customers. We're interested in novel use cases, challenges using Heroku and any other feedback for the product. Put simply, we wanted to talk more, and more directly, to all of you about what we're working on and what we _should_ be working on next.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Security, stability, and availability of Heroku is our top priority. That means we cannot commit to hard deadlines for new feature work because plans may change due to operational priorities. We're strongly comitted transparancy in the roadmap and will update issues as we make progress or if we encounter delays. Items on the roadmap are not a firm guarantee that a feature will be released.


**Q: Is everything on the roadmap?**

A: The majority of our development work for Heroku are included on the roadmap. Smaller incremental improvements/changes may be scheduled more opportunistically and may not be represented.


**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**

A: Please open an issue! Community submitted issues will be tagged "Proposed" and we'll review them regularly.
