## Salesforce Heroku Roadmap

This is the public roadmap for Salesforce Heroku. Welcome!

[See the roadmap Â»](https://github.com/orgs/heroku/projects/130)

## Introduction
Salesforce would like to share more about what we're researching and working on to make it easier to view, and share feedback on upcoming improvements to Heroku.

A tip of the hat in thanks to the [AWS Containers team's public roadmap](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap) for inspiration on the formatting and approach.

### Scope

This roadmap covers only services in the Heroku family of products. To see roadmaps for other Salesforce products take a look at the [Salesforce Architects Roadmap Explorer](https://architect.salesforce.com/roadmaps/roadmap-explorer), or the [Salesforce IdeaExchange](https://ideas.salesforce.com/).

We welcome both comments on existing roadmap items via the underlying Github issues, as well as posting your own feature requests or ideas for improvements to Heroku via new issues.

## FAQs

**Q: What do the roadmap categories mean?** 

* *Researching* - We're looking into this idea, often in the form of requirements gathering or thinking through potential designs. This is a great time to show support or dissent for various features.
* *Working on it* - Actively being worked on. We're looking to finalize requirements as quickly as reasonable, but the details are often still flexible.  This is an ideal time to share feedback on individual items.
* *Coming soon* - We expect to deliver this within the next month or two, roughly. Changes at this point are more likely to be more fine-grained details. Items tagged pilot, beta, or dev preview may be in this state for longer as we work on getting them to GA.
* *Shipped* - Done & delivered at as generally available, unless otherwise noted.

**Q: Why did you build this?**

A: We wanted to share more about what we're working on, but especially want to hear from customers about novel use cases, challenges, or any other kind of feedback. Put simply, we wanted to talk more, and more directly, to all of you about what we're working on and what we _should_ be working on next.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Our top priority is a focus on security, stability, and availability of our services, which means we need to remain flexible on some aspects of feature development and delivery timelines to ensure we can keep that level of trust in place without compromise. We're strongly comitted to being transparent in this project, but we need to note that plans can and do change. As such items on the roadmap are not a firm guarantee that a feature will be released.


**Q: Is everything on the roadmap?**

A: The majority of our development work for Salesforce's Heroku projects are included on this roadmap. Smaller incremental improvements/changes may be scheduled more opportunistically and not represented on this roadmap, depending on utility.  Of course, this doesn't preclude the occasional project that we may launch without notice in order to preserve the element of surprise.


**Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?**

A: Please open an issue! Community submitted issues will be tagged "Proposed" and we'll review them regularly.
